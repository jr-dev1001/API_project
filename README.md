# shapeAi_project_cybersec
This is for shapeAI cybeersecurity project.
Here we are mainly concentrating on the concept of API(Application Programming interface).
API works between client and the server.
API takes the request from the client and tronsport to server and ther server response will be given to the client again.
And the code explains the data we requested from the server for wheather focast data and how we've retrive the data by using python.
In this we import the request module to get a response from the server.
And we are reading the into a text file using pyhton file handling concept.
That's the text file is a demo wheather the code is reading and writing it in a text file.
